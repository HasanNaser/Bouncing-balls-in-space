 
#Implement a bouncing ball simulation using simple AI techniques in Processing 

 
In the simulation;

 - At least 5 balls (circle) with arbitrary size (Radius) and colors should be in the scene.
 - Collision detection should be developed against balls to walls (edge of the frame/window) and circles to circles. 
 - Direction and speed (acceleration) should be changed rationally on collision.
 
 
<h3> I was took it as homework in the first lecture of artificial intelligence . </h3>
I made two different versions ..!

- Bouncing balls
- Bad ball
